		<div class="workHistoryEntryHeader">{PositionTitle} - {CompanyWorkedFor} <span class="workHistoryEntryTime">{StartDate} to ({LastDate or Current}</div>
		<div class="workHistoryEntrySummary">{Brief summary of the position}</div>
		<ul class="workHistoryEntryTasks>
			{{{For each task/project/responbility}}
			<li>{Task/project/responbility description}</li>
		</ul>
		</div>
	<div class="skillList">
		{{{For each skill sorted by highest skill levels first}}}
