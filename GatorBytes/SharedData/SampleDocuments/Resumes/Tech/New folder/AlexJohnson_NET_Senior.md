Contoso is a mid-size financial services company specializing in loan origination and servicing platforms used by internal teams and external partners.

#### Role Overview

Progressed from Software Engineer I to Senior Software Engineer with two promotions over ~4.5 years. Initially focused on implementing features and fixing defects in a large monolithic ASP.NET application, then moved into designing new .NET Core-based microservices, improving performance and reliability, and mentoring junior developers. Limited but direct involvement in front-end changes when needed, primarily in legacy Knockout.js and a newer Angular-based admin portal.

#### Key Responsibilities

- **Backend & Service Development**
  - Designed and implemented RESTful APIs using **ASP.NET Core** for loan application processing, risk evaluation, and document management.
  - Refactored legacy ASP.NET MVC code into modular layers, improving testability and maintainability.
  - Built background processing services in .NET Core (hosted services) to handle scheduled batch jobs (e.g., nightly reconciliation, report generation).

- **Data Access & SQL**
  - Developed and maintained EF Core data models, migrations, and repositories for multiple microservices.
  - Wrote and tuned T-SQL queries and stored procedures for moderately complex reporting and transaction workflows.
  - Collaborated with DBAs on indexing and query optimization for performance-sensitive parts of the application.

- **System Integration**
  - Integrated with third-party credit bureaus and payment gateways via HTTP APIs and message queues.
  - Implemented robust error handling, retries, and logging for external integrations using Polly and Serilog.

- **Mentoring & Collaboration**
  - Performed regular code reviews, focusing on clarity, maintainability, and adherence to coding standards.
  - Mentored 2–3 junior and mid-level developers on C#, .NET patterns, and debugging techniques.
  - Provided technical input during refinement sessions, helping to break down work into implementable backend tasks.

- **Front-End (Limited Scope)**
  - Made targeted updates to a legacy **Knockout.js**-based loan servicing dashboard (e.g., binding new fields, minor validation, correcting data flows).
  - Implemented small adjustments and bug fixes in an **Angular**-based admin portal, primarily related to API integration and form validation.
  - Coordinated with front-end specialists when UI/UX complexity exceeded working knowledge.

#### Selected Achievements

- **Promotion to Senior Software Engineer**
  - Recognized for consistently owning complex backend features and for significantly improving the reliability of the loan processing API.
  - Led the backend design of a new loan pre-qualification microservice using .NET 6 and EF Core, reducing average response time by ~35% compared to the legacy implementation.

- **Legacy Modernization Efforts**
  - Spearheaded the decomposition of a high-traffic loan status module from the monolithic ASP.NET application into an independent .NET Core API.
  - Introduced layered architecture and standardized DTOs, enabling other teams to integrate more easily and reducing defects related to data mapping.

- **Reliability & Observability Improvements**
  - Implemented structured logging with Serilog and centralized logging to Azure Application Insights, enabling faster diagnosis of production issues.
  - Added health checks and readiness endpoints, allowing for safer rolling deployments and more effective monitoring.

- **Testing & Quality**
  - Increased unit and integration test coverage for critical services from ~25% to ~65% over 18 months.
  - Established testing patterns (fixtures, test data builders) reused across multiple teams.
