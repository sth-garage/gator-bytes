====================================================================== ACADEMIC PROJECTS
Library Inventory Management System (Team Project)
Language/Tools: Java, JUnit, Git
Duration: Jan 2025 – Apr 2025

Developed a console-based library inventory system in Java to manage books, patrons, checkouts, and returns.
Implemented core business logic including adding/removing books, tracking due dates, and calculating late fees using object-oriented design principles.
Designed and implemented custom data structures using Java Collections (ArrayList, HashMap) to store and retrieve records efficiently.
Wrote unit tests in JUnit to validate key methods (e.g., search, checkout, and overdue calculations), improving reliability during future changes.
Collaborated using Git and GitHub for version control, handling branching and code reviews across a team of three.
Reflection:

Enjoyed designing the class structure and seeing how good object-oriented design made later changes much easier.
Found it especially rewarding to write unit tests and watch them pass as new features were added, which boosted confidence in the code.
Multithreaded File Processing Tool (Individual Project)
Language/Tools: Java, Threads, Synchronization
Duration: Sep 2024 – Dec 2024

Built a Java application that processes large text files in parallel, counting word frequencies and generating summary reports.
Used Java threads and synchronization (locks) to safely manage shared data structures while achieving speed-ups on multi-core systems.
Implemented command-line arguments to configure the number of worker threads and input/output file paths.
Performed basic performance testing by measuring execution time with different thread counts and file sizes.
Reflection:

Particularly liked experimenting with threads and observing how concurrency could speed up processing on big files.
Learned to appreciate how tricky synchronization can be, and enjoyed the challenge of debugging race conditions and deadlocks.
Simple Chat Server and Client (Team Project)
Language/Tools: Java, Sockets, Git
Duration: Jan 2024 – May 2024

Co-developed a basic text-based chat application using Java sockets, with a multi-client server and simple console clients.
Implemented server logic to handle multiple clients concurrently using threads, including join/leave notifications and broadcasting messages.
Added basic server-side logging of chat sessions to text files for later review.
Participated in code reviews and pair programming sessions to improve code quality and learn different approaches to problem-solving.
Reflection:

Really enjoyed seeing networking concepts “come to life” and watching multiple clients communicate through the server.
Found working in a small team rewarding, especially learning how to break up tasks and integrate code smoothly with version control.
====================================================================== LEADERSHIP & ATHLETICS
Ohio State University Baseball Team – Team Captain
Columbus, OH | Aug 2021 – May 2025

Elected captain for junior and senior seasons based on leadership, discipline, and consistent effort.
Led pre-season and in-season training sessions, coordinating with coaching staff and teammates to maintain high performance and morale.
Balanced 20+ hours per week of practice, games, and travel with a full course load in Computer Science.
Developed strong communication skills by serving as a liaison between players and coaches.
Ohio State University Football Team – Player (Defensive Back)
Columbus, OH | Aug 2020 – Dec 2022

Competed at the collegiate level while maintaining academic responsibilities.
Gained experience working under pressure, adapting to rapidly changing situations, and staying focused during high-stakes events.
====================================================================== WORK & OTHER EXPERIENCE
Student Programming Tutor (Part-Time)
Ohio State University Computer Science Department
Columbus, OH | Jan 2024 – May 2025

Assisted fellow students with introductory and intermediate Java programming assignments and exam preparation.
Explained concepts such as loops, conditionals, classes, inheritance, and basic data structures in understandable terms.
Helped students debug code using the IDE, console output, and step-through debugging tools.
Reinforced my own understanding by teaching others and breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.
Summer Camp Counselor
Columbus Community Youth Sports Camp
Columbus, OH | Summers 2022 & 2023

Led groups of 15–20 children (ages 8–14) in daily sports activities, games, and team-building exercises.
Coordinated with other counselors to ensure a safe, structured, and positive environment.
Developed patience, communication, and conflict-resolution skills while working with diverse groups of children and parents.
