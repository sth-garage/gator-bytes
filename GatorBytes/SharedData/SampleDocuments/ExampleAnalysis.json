Investment in science upskilling will be necessary for full alignment with the science-specific curriculum and assessment needs of grades 2\u20135, but her strong foundation and enthusiastic approach bode well for rapid development.

However, her direct experience in upper elementary (grades 2\u20135) science content, NGSS-aligned curriculum, and assessment is limited: her resume centers on early childhood STEM and K\u20132. She is a fast learner with a strong growth mindset and would rapidly acquire science expertise with intentional PD and mentorship. If science content depth (grades 2\u20135) is the top priority, her readiness may not be immediate; if culture-building, innovation, and adaptability are paramount, Jacobs is an excellent, long-term value hire.\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/section\u003E\u003Csection class=\\\u0022section\\\u0022 id=\\\u0022positives\\\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\\\u0022section-header\\\u0022\u003EStrengths (Match Positives)\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\\\u0022section-body\\\u0022\u003E\u003Cul class=\\\u0022list\\\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003ERecognized excellence in K\u20132 teaching (Teacher of the Year, Tech Innovation Grant)\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EExpertise in educational technology and STEM integration (SMART Boards, coding, tech clubs)\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EOutstanding classroom management and differentiated, inclusive teaching\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EDemonstrated leadership (grade-level team lead, code club founder, mentoring)\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EStrong skills in family and community engagement (award-winning events, PTA)\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EGrowth mindset with active participation in professional development\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EEffective communication and collaboration with colleagues\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ERecord of student achievement and innovative lesson design\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/section\u003E\u003Csection class=\\\u0022section\\\u0022 id=\\\u0022negatives\\\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\\\u0022section-header\\\u0022\u003EGaps or Risks (Match Negatives)\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\\\u0022section-body\\\u0022\u003E\u003Cul class=\\\u0022list\\\u0022\u003E\u003Cli\u003ELimited documented experience with grades 2\u20135 science curriculum \u0026 instruction\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003ENo explicit record of NGSS-aligned, inquiry-based science curriculum work\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EScience content expertise for upper elementary is not evident\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EHands-on, project-based science assessment for grades 2\u20135 is not detailed\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EImmediate fit gap for upper elementary science subject-matter leadership\u003C/li\u003E\u003Cli\u003EOnboarding/training in science-specific pedagogy will be required\u003C/li\u003E\u003C/ul\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003C/section\u003E\u003Csection class=\\\u0022section\\\u0022 id=\\\u0022agents\\\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\\\u0022section-header\\\u0022\u003EAgent Evaluations\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\\\u0022section-body\\\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\\\u0022agent\\\u0022 id=\\\u0022agent-Taylor Grant\\\u0022\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\\\u0022agent-name\\\u0022\u003ETaylor Grant\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\\\u0022agent-match-line\\\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan class=\\\u0022label\\\u0022\u003EMatch:\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan class=\\\u0022score-badge score-orange\\\u0022\u003E74.00%\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan class=\\\u0022label\\\u0022\u003E? vs Overall:\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan class=\\\u0022diff diff-neutral\\\u0022\u003E0.00%\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cdiv class=\\\u0022agent-justification\\\u0022\u003E\u003Cspan class=\\\u0022label\\\u0022\u003EJustification:\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan class=\\\u0022text\\\u0022\u003EEmily Jacobs demonstrates exemplary teaching, technology integration, lesson design, and community engagement.
